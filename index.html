        <p class="lb_text">
          Captain America, also known as Steve Rogers, is an iconic superhero in
          the Marvel Universe. His origin story is one of transformation and
          patriotism, as a frail and sickly young man who becomes the pinnacle
          of human potential after undergoing the Super-Soldier Serum experiment
          during World War II.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Clad in his trademark red, white, and blue costume with a Vibranium
          shield, Captain America embodies the American spirit, standing as a
          symbol of hope, justice, and the pursuit of a better world. He fights
          against various villains and threats, often leading superhero teams
          like the Avengers, showcasing not only his physical prowess but also
          his exceptional leadership and strategic skills.

        <p class="lb_text">
          Thor Odinson, often simply referred to as Thor, is a prominent
          character in the Marvel Universe and a member of the superhero team,
          the Avengers. He is based on the Norse god of thunder and wields the
          enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, which grants him the ability to control
          lightning and storms, as well as superhuman strength and durability.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Thor hails from the mythical realm of Asgard and is the son of Odin,
          the All-Father, making him a powerful and noble figure in both the
          realms of gods and mortals. He is often depicted as a warrior with a
          strong sense of honor and duty, dedicated to protecting the realms
          from various threats, including his mischievous adoptive brother,
          Loki, and formidable foes like the Frost Giants and Dark Elves.
